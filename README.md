# Sparsh Vaani (स्पर्श वाणी)

Sparsh Vaani is an open-source Android application designed to assist individuals with severe speech and motor impairments. Inspired by a personal story of a young girl with spinal growth issues and limited mobility, this app provides a simple "Tap to Speech" interface.

## Features

- **Large Tap Targets**: Designed for users with limited hand mobility.
- **Hindi & English Support**: Currently configured to speak in Hindi with bilingual labels.
- **Common Phrases**: Quick access to essential needs like Water, Food, Pain, Medicine, and emotions.
- **Built with Jetpack Compose**: Modern, reactive UI for a smooth experience.

## How it Works

The app displays a grid of cards representing different needs. When a user taps a card, the Android Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine speaks the corresponding phrase aloud.
